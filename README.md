# Frog Game

Frog Game is a 2D platformer game built using the Godot Game Engine. In this game, a frog roams around a certain area, overcomes obstacles, and aims to find the desired trophy. On its way, the frog can collect apples that contain points. If the frog reaches the trophy, the level is completed, and it can proceed to the next level, facing increasing difficulty.
